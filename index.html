        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="start">
          Creating a website committed to studying the details of decision-making and its effects is
          a venture born out of the knowledge of the important role that choices play in forming our
          lives, organizations, and communities. The origin of this website lies in the
          understanding that every choice, from the mundane to the massive, adds to a
          complicated web of results touching not just the decision-maker but also the wider
          community and environment. This tool is meant to dig into the details of decision-making
          processes, exploring the factors that affect our decisions and the far-reaching effects
          they can have.
          The study on decision-making covers a broad range of fields, including psychology,
          neuroscience, economics, and management science. It aims to discover how choices
          are made, the flaws and patterns that affect them, and the tactics that can improve
          decision quality. By combining ideas from these varied areas, the website tries to offer a
          complete view of decision-making, stressing both its academic roots and practical uses.
          Moreover, this study will explore the impact of decision-making on personal
          development, group growth, and social progress. It will examine how successful
          decision-making can lead to better results in various areas of life, such as job success,
          personal relationships, and general well-being. Conversely, it will also study the effects
          of bad choices, including missed chances, resource loss, and negative social affects.
          The need for heightened understanding around the theme of decision-making stems
          from the fact that, despite its importance, the topic often gets poor attention in official
          education and professional training. Enhancing understanding of decision-making
          processes and their consequences can encourage people to make more educated,
          responsible, and effective choices. This understanding can lead to better personal
          choices, more successful groups, and a more fair and healthy society.
          In closing, this website is not just an intellectual effort but a goal to promote a greater
          understanding of the art and science of decision-making. By offering a stage for
          education, conversation, and study, it aims to arm guests with the information and tools
          necessary to manage the difficulties of decision-making. Ultimately, the goal is to create
          a group of educated decision-makers who are capable of driving good change in their
          lives and the world at large.

        <h2>Theme analysis</h2>
        <p class="start">
          "Letters from Thailand" offers a rich tapestry of how choices shape our lives, cleverly
intertwined with the immigrant experience of Suang U and his family. The story starts
with a life-altering choice by Suang U to leave China for Thailand, driven by a quest for
better chances. This key choice not only shows the immigrant's desire of a better life but
also sets the stage for studying detailed cultural dynamics.
Suang U's reveal of his reading early in the story, which leads to his work and the
formation of important relationships, underscores the possible benefits of taking
chances. Yet, this choice also alienates his friend Seng, showing how decisions can
simultaneously open new doors and close others.
The effect of Suang U's choices stretches to his family life, especially in his bond with his
son, Weng Khim. Suang U's strict and controlled parenting style, meant for his son's
growth, eventually stresses their relationship and adds to Weng Khim's disobedient
actions. Weng Khim's own decisions, especially his relationship with a prostitute named
Phanni and the subsequent turmoil, further highlight the theme of choices and their deep
effects on personal and family dynamics.
The sad result of a family trip, chosen to celebrate Weng Khim's wedding, culminates in
the loss of Suang U's wife due to a decision to hire a driver, showing how unexpected
effects of our choices can lead to permanent loss. Throughout "Letters from Thailand,"
the story clearly shows the spread effects of decisions, showing their ability to shape fate
and the importance of awareness in our choices.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>A. Literature review</h3>
        <p class="start">
          Decision making is a crucial process we engage in every day. The
          choices we make can have a big impact on our lives, affecting our
          well-being and success. This literature review explores decision
          making and its effects by summarizing information from reliable
          sources. One important aspect comes from Kahneman and Tversky's
          Prospect Theory. They found that our decisions are influenced not only
          by expected outcomes but also by how options are presented and our
          perception of gains and losses. Cognitive biases and risk reluctant
          play a role in shaping our choices. Another perspective comes from
          Thaler and Sunstein's book, "Nudge." They discuss how small changes in
          how choices are presented can influence decision making. By
          structuring choices differently, we can help people make better
          decisions without limiting their freedom. This can be applied to areas
          like health, finance, and overall well-being. Emotions also play a
          significant role in decision making, as highlighted by Lerner and
          Keltner. Different emotions can lead to different decision outcomes.
          Positive emotions may make us more prone to taking risks, while
          negative emotions can make us more cautious. Ariely's work in
          "Predictably Irrational" explores the irrational aspects of decision
          making. He provides examples where people's choices don't align with
          traditional economic models of rationality. Social norms, relativity,
          and self-control all influence our decision outcomes. Simon's concept
          of "bounded rationality" challenges the idea of perfect rational
          decision making. He argues that we have limitations in terms of
          information, time, and cognitive capacity. As a result, we often make
          satisfactory choices rather than optimal ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, this review highlights the presence of decision biases,
          the impact of emotions, the influence of choice architecture, and the
          limitations of rational decision making. Understanding these factors
          can empower individuals to make better choices in various areas of
          life.

        <h3>B. Research problem</h3>

        <p class="start">
          Effective decision-making is a crucial skill that shapes our lives in deep ways. "Letters
from Thailand" provides important insights into this process, stressing the importance of
considering long-term effects and understanding the impact of our decisions. This article
discusses key aspects of decision-making, including its impact on our lives, the
importance of planning, and the role of ethical concerns.
In "Letters from Thailand," the protagonist makes various choices that greatly impact his
life and the lives of those around him. From moving to a new country to managing family
relationships, Suang U's choices show the complexity of decision-making. By studying
his experiences, we can learn important lessons about making informed and mindful
decisions.
One key part of successful decision-making is understanding the long-term effects of our
actions. Suang U's actions echo through generations, showing the ongoing effect of our
choices. Whether it's picking a job path or deciding how to handle relationships,
considering the future consequences of our choices is important for achieving long-term
happiness and joy.
In addition to knowing the effects of our decisions, it's also important to consider the
factors that affect our decision-making process. Personal beliefs, social forces, and
available information all play a role in forming our choices. By being aware of these
factors, we can make choices that fit with our ideals and goals.
Ethical issues often appear in decision-making, requiring us to balance our personal
ethics with possible results. Suang U's experiences show the difficulties of managing
these issues and fighting groupthink. By closely examining the moral consequences of
our decisions, we can make choices that support our ethics and add positively to society.
In conclusion, effective decision-making is a basic aspect of managing life's difficulties.
By learning from the experiences of characters like Suang U in "Letters from Thailand"
and considering lessons from psychology and health tools, we can improve our ability to
make informed and aware choices. Ultimately, understanding the effect of our decisions
and trying to make choices that fit with our goals and aims are important for personal
growth and community well-being.

        <h3>C. Research Participant and research questions</h3>

        <p class="start">
         <p><u><b>Interviewee background</b></u></p> <br>
          <p class="start">We have chosen a candidate who is presently enrolled in a 
          Bachelor of Arts program at the Department of Media and Management 
          . Our selection of this participant was based on her firsthand encounters 
          with navigating challenging decisions. Specifically, she found herself 
          compelled by familial expectations to select a marriage partner due to 
          societal pressures associated with her age and marital status. Despite 
          these pressures, she remained steadfast in her desire to pursue her 
          educational aspirations and fulfill her dreams. Employing various 
          strategies, she endeavored to articulate to her family the potential 
          impact of marriage on her future, ultimately succeeding in garnering 
          their understanding and respect for her decision.
        </p><br>
        <p><b><u>Interview script</u></b> </p><br>
          <p><b>Interviewer:</b> How to you define effectiveness of decision making? <br>
            <b>Interviewee:</b> For me, effectiveness of decision making is a decision that you don’t 
          regret doing it 
          Which you are contented to do it. <br>
          <b>Interviewer:</b>  Can you provide examples of decision that have significant impact? <br>
          <b>Interviewee:</b> One example that I find having significant impact is choosing 
          marriage partner.<br>
          <b>Interviewer:</b>  How do you consider the long-term consequences of decision?<br>
          <b>Interviewee:</b> I think there are many impacts to long-term consequences of 
          decision. For instance, emotional well-being, when you choose the wrong partner 
          to marry it make us despondent that could cause you prolonged stress not only 
          impacting your mental health but your daily life problems such as not doing a 
          good job at work. It is the same goes for your life style, wrong partner means 
          unhealthy life style. You will drink alcohol to relieve your stress leading to physical 
          health problems.<br>
          <b>Interviewer:</b>  What factor do you think influence decision making the most?<br>
          <b>Interviewee:</b> Generally, making decision varies differently depending on people. <br>
          But if you talk about choosing to build a family it is likely to be influence by family 
          members. It can be socially influence. But what influence decision making the 
          most is none other than yourself.<br>
          <b>Interviewer:</b>  How to you handle ethical dilemma in decision making?<br>
          <b>Interviewee:</b> There are three approach I can come up with. Firstly, consult with 
          someone who has more experiences than yourself such as your best friend, family 
          members, elder and professional. Secondly, you need to personally list down the 
          advantages and disadvantages to widen your decision as it will give you 
          abundance of choices. Lastly, you need to contemplate your decision for long term 
          effectiveness. You could look up and do some research online because there are 
          copious choices you could choose.</p>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p class="start">
          <p class="start">
            In an insightful interview, we engaged with a participant named "Jordan" (a pseudonym to ensure privacy) to explore their perceptions of decision-making effectiveness. Jordan characterizes effective decision-making as making choices that one does not regret and feels contented with, emphasizing personal fulfillment over external validation or immediate outcomes. This perspective offers a rich, introspective view into the complex nature of making choices that have lasting impacts on one's life.

Jordan provided a poignant example of a decision with significant impact: choosing a marriage partner. This choice exemplifies the profound effect personal decisions can have on one's emotional well-being, lifestyle, and even professional performance. Jordan's reflections suggest that the consequences of such decisions extend far beyond the immediate, affecting one's mental health, job performance, and physical health due to lifestyle changes driven by stress or dissatisfaction.

The discussion on factors influencing decision-making revealed an interesting dichotomy between external social influences and personal agency. Jordan posits that while family and social circles can impact decisions, especially those related to personal life and family building, the most critical influencer is oneself. This insight underscores the importance of self-awareness and personal values in guiding decisions, resonating with themes from existing literature that highlight the role of individual agency in effective decision-making.

Handling ethical dilemmas, according to Jordan, involves a multifaceted approach that includes seeking advice, weighing pros and cons, and considering long-term implications. This pragmatic strategy mirrors academic discussions on ethical decision-making, advocating for a balanced consideration of various perspectives and the potential long-term effects of decisions.

Comparing Jordan's insights with findings from thematic analyses and literature reviews reveals a nuanced understanding of decision-making. Literature often emphasizes rational, systematic approaches to decision-making, while thematic analyses may highlight the emotional and psychological dimensions. Jordan's narrative bridges these perspectives, illustrating how personal satisfaction, emotional well-being, and individual agency play crucial roles in what is considered effective decision-making. This comparison enriches our understanding by highlighting the value of integrating both rational and emotional considerations in making decisions that align with one's values and long-term goals.

The project's benefits are manifold, offering insights into the subjective nature of decision-making and emphasizing the importance of personal contentment as a criterion for effectiveness. It also illustrates the value of qualitative research in capturing the complexity of human experiences, providing depth and context to theoretical frameworks. This exploration enriches our understanding of decision-making, contributing to a more holistic view that incorporates both logical and emotional aspects.

          organizing skills set a positive tone for our teamwork, while Hak's technical knowledge
          was important in building an approachable platform for our project. Monyleak, Kimsreng,
          Sreypich, and Mongkul's commitment to thorough study and data collection guaranteed
          the consistency of our results. Additionally, we express our thanks to our peers and
          teachers who provided useful comments and support throughout the project's length.
          In conclusion, our project's success was supported by effective peer teamwork, where
          each team member's unique skills and talents were leveraged to achieve our shared
          goals. Despite facing challenges, our joint effort and determination allowed us to create a
          thorough and clear study of decision-making effects. We respect and value the efforts of
          all involved, without which the project would not have been possible.
